This branch contains the same solutions to the exercises as the [solutions branch](https://github.com/goldmansachs/gs-collections-kata/tree/solutions) but depends on language features in Java 8. Specifically, these solutions use lambdas and method references instead of anonymous inner classes. We used an early sandbox version of Java 8 so the syntax is subject to change.
